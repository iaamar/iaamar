## **Work Experience**

### **Software Engineer at Coforge**
* I was part of the core software dev and delivery team where I worked on core java development and MERN stack
* Led cross-functional teams in Java development to build bug-free, full-stack low-latency software, creating ~30 RESTAPIs
* Code reviewed, and assisted PMs & architects to craft SRS from feature design, planning, and execution from scratch to production ready. Achieved ~17.7%â†‘ revenue growth from $0.8 million to $1.5 million
* Delivered 20+ client requests which involved architectural changes to make fail-proof system, achieving ~17.7% rev. growth
* Led in CI/CD, functional docs, the team worked in a fast-paced env., shipping features enhancing performance by 30%
* Streamlined deployment, and improved software quality through testing, debugging, and peer coding
* Leveraged existing code for Singapore's Urban Authority, enhanced end-to-end use cases using Java 8 features, and configured MVC architecture, and session factories, this increased efficiency in processing huge PDFs and reports like data
* Engineered resource-intensive SQL queries into joins/early retrieval/bypass irreverent rows, reducing complexity by 30%
* Reduced turnaround time by optimizing functions using appropriate data structures like maps and libraries for early read/write. Year-on-year product revenue grew from 18% to 24.5%
* Skills: Java, JavaScript, React-Native, MERN, AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Postman, MySQL, NodeJs, NextJs, Git


### **Software Engineer Intern at Ombre**
* I was part of mobile app dev team 
* Only intern to author live streaming use cases to production, improved architecture to BLoC level to lazy load UI. Resulting in a noteworthy surge in installs of ~15K under 4 months
* Implemented notification systems in the JavaScript framework to minimize front-end computation, contributing to the app's remarkable resurgence
* Skills: Flutter, React, NextJS, Node, Firebase, JavaScript, MVC, Dart, AppStore, TestFlight
